Whether you're a new or returning user, **we're thrilled you've decided to pick up Lix!**

Lix works out-of-the-box on most Linux and MacOS systems, including with system management tools
such as [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) and
[nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) -- but, like any Nix-based system, some Nix background
knowledge is recommended before installation.

If you're new to the Nix ecosystem, you may want to check out some [community resources](/resources)
first, to get familiar with how Nix works.


## On NixOS

If you haven't already installed NixOS, do so using any upstream
[install image](https://nixos.org/download/#NixOS) and the instructions in the
[NixOS Manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation).

Then, follow the [instructions to add Lix to your
configuration](/add-to-config). Both flake-based and non-flake-based
configurations are fully supported.


## On an Existing `nix-darwin` Install

If you already have a [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) installation, you
can use the same instructions as installing on a NixOS-based system. Follow the instructions
for either:

- [flake-based configurations](/add-to-config#flake-based-configurations); or
- [non-flake configurations](/add-to-config#non-flake-configurations)

depending on how you prefer to configure your system.


## On Any Other Linux/MacOS System

You can either perform a **new install**, or choose to
**upgrade an existing install** to Lix.

### New Installs

The easiest way to install Lix is to use the [Lix Installer](https://git.lix.systems/lix-project/lix-installer)[^1].
Open a terminal, and run the following command:

```sh
curl -sSf -L https://install.lix.systems/lix | sh -s -- install
```

The installer will guide you through installing Lix -- and once it's finished,
you'll have a full, working installation. If you're not sure what to do, now is a
great time to check out some of the [community's resources on Nix](/resources).

[^1]: a customized variant of the [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer).

### Existing Installs

If you have an existing Nix installation (either CppNix or Lix), you should be able to upgrade by using a variant
of the `upgrade-nix` command.

Thanks to Nix, we can actually ask Lix to upgrade your system directly. Run the following command:

```sh
sudo --preserve-env=PATH nix run \
     --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" \
     --extra-substituters https://cache.lix.systems --extra-trusted-public-keys "cache.lix.systems:aBnZUw8zA7H35Cz2RyKFVs3H4PlGTLawyY5KRbvJR8o=" \
     'git+https://git.lix.systems/lix-project/lix?ref=refs/tags/@VERSION_NOTRAIL@' -- \
     upgrade-nix \
     --extra-substituters https://cache.lix.systems --extra-trusted-public-keys "cache.lix.systems:aBnZUw8zA7H35Cz2RyKFVs3H4PlGTLawyY5KRbvJR8o="
```

You should now have upgraded to Lix! You can verify this by asking the `nix` command
to report its version:

```sh
$ nix --version
nix (Lix, like Nix) @VERSION_NOTRAIL@
```

As long as you see `Lix` in the output, you're good! If you're not sure what to do now, it's a
great time to check out some of the [community's resources on Nix](/resources).
