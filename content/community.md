Lix exists **first and foremost for its community** -- and we very much hope that will include you!
If you're looking for help, have any questions, want to pitch in -- or just want to talk -- join us
using [one of the venues below](#engaging-with-the-community) .

## Community Standards

As part of our responsibility to community, we are dedicated to creating a safe and welcoming environment
in which our community can create great things together.

Accordingly, we've developed a set of [community standards](/community-standards), which all contributors
are expected to follow.

## Governance

Lix is developed by a community of passionate users! We have no "benevolent dictator for life",
nor a small foundation board that governs the community. Instead, **we rely on teams of our developers
and users to carry the burdens of maintenance and governance**.

We're currently in the process of establishing a more full-fledged governance model, which we believe must
be built on engagement with -- and feedback from -- our community. In the interim, decisions are made by
simple voting, with one vote held by each member of the "[core team](/team)", who are acting as interim
governance.

## Engaging with the Community

The best way to engage with the community currently is to **join our Matrix space** -- a decentralized 
chat platform commonly used among open-source projects.

### Lix Matrix

Joining is relatively straightforward -- you can find us on the `lix.systems` Matrix server.
The easiest way to connect with us is to join our [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#space:lix.systems),
which will allow you to see previews of and join the most relevant community rooms.

Note that all community venues -- including our Matrix rooms -- are subject to our [community standards](/community-standards).

### Community Resources

In order to help folks who are getting started or who want to learn more about Lix, we've created a curated
list of [community resources](/resources) that you may find helpful. If you have suggestions, feel free to
drop them in our Matrix chat!
