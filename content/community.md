Lix exists **first and foremost for its community** --- and we very much hope that will include you!
If you're looking for help, have any questions, want to pitch in --- or just want to talk --- feel free to join us.

Our community is spread across two platforms (partially bridged), **Matrix** and **Zulip**.

If you're mostly a curious Lix user, you'll likely want to join Matrix first, especially if you're more familiar with that platform.
Joining is relatively straightforward --- you can find us on the **`lix.systems` Matrix server**.
The easiest way to connect with us is to join our [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#space:lix.systems),
which will allow you to see previews of and join the most relevant community rooms.

Most of our more technical discussions around development happen over on **Zulip, at <https://zulip.lix.systems>**.
You need a Lix ID to participate in the conversation, but creating an Account with GitHub log in takes two clicks and you can always decouple things later.
Beware: Your username will then be your GitHub username, if you want something else we recommend you create a Lix account manually, because renaming the account afterwards is a bit of a headache.

## Community Standards

As part of our responsibility to community, we are dedicated to creating a safe and welcoming environment
in which our community can create great things together.

Accordingly, we've developed a set of [community standards](/community-standards), which all contributors
are expected to follow.

## Governance

Lix is developed by a community of passionate users!
Our governance and team structure is designed to be fairly minimal and lightweight.
You can check it out over at [About Us](/team).
