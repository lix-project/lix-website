**Lix** is developed by a community of passionate users! We have no "benevolent dictator for life",
nor a small foundation board that governs the community. Instead, we rely on teams of our developers
and users to carry the burdens of maintenance and governance.

## Core Team

The **core team** are the developers most directly responsible for the Lix project. While the project
is in its "soft-release" period, these folks are responsible for project governance. One of their main
tasks is to establish a lasting governance model -- and other teams to handle things!

the Lix channels and say hello -- we'd love to hear what you think of Lix!

## Conflict of Interest Statements

As a community project, it's important that project decisions are made **exclusively for the
benefit of the community**, and don't serve any other interests -- including personal or corporate gain.

If a team member is unable to do so in any context, they are **required** to disclose the _conflict of interest_
and to recuse themselves from any leadership decisions affected.

As transparency is important, we've included declarations from each core team member regarding any possible
conflicts of interest.

  sponsors Lix development. TMLLC declares that it has no financial stake in the future of Lix or Nix,
  no ties to the military-industrial-complex, and a strong commitment to avoiding such ties. TMLLC is
  owned by individuals, and not VC investors. Kate accordingly declares she has **no conflicts of interest**
  regarding governance of Lix.
