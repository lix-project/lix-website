**Lix** is developed by a community of passionate users! We have no "benevolent dictator for life",
nor a small foundation board that governs the community. Instead, we rely on teams of our developers
and users to carry the burdens of maintenance and governance.

## Core Team

The **core team** are the developers most directly responsible for the Lix project. While the project
is in its "soft-release" period, these folks are responsible for project governance. One of their main
tasks is to establish a lasting governance model -- and other teams to handle things!

Members (in alphabetical order):

- **hexchen ([@hexchen](https://github.com/hexchen), she/her)**  
  hexchen is working primarily on maintaining and extending the Lix project infrastructure.

- **Irenes ([@IreneKnapp](https://github.com/IreneKnapp), they/them)**  
  Irenes are an outside-context problem. They are fond of cats.

- **jade ([@lf-](https://github.com/lf-), they/them)**  
  jade is working on packaging, testing, infrastructure, tooling, review, stability, and a large amount of 
  the writing in Lix. They recently graduated from a Computer Engineering program at UBC in Canada.

- **Kate Temkin ([@ktemkin](https://github.com/ktemkin), she/her [singular] or they/them [plural])**  
  A performance art piece written live by a collective of hardware hackers & low-level engineers.

  rewriting every bit of documentation ever to cross paths with Nix.

  Raito is working on nixpkgs packaging, infrastructure, and review in Lix.

the Lix channels and say hello -- we'd love to hear what you think of Lix!

## Conflict of Interest Statements

As a community project, it's important that project decisions are made **exclusively for the
benefit of the community**, and don't serve any other interests -- including personal or corporate gain.

If a team member is unable to do so in any context, they are **required** to disclose the _conflict of interest_
and to recuse themselves from any leadership decisions affected.

As transparency is important, we've included declarations from each core team member regarding any possible
conflicts of interest.

- **hexchen**'s employer and its sister companies use Nix/Lix internally and offer Nix-based consulting.
  hexchen has no stake in the company, does not work in the consulting teams and there is no
  expectation for her to contribute to Lix on company time. **Should a governance decision involving
  these or any other financial ties arise, hexchen will recuse herself from decision-making.**

- **Irene Knapp** (they/them) is the technology director of Internet Safety Labs (ISL), a US-based 501(c)(3) 
  non-profit. To the best of Irene's knowledge, ISL has no financial involvement with any Lix or Nix 
  effort or organization, other than its own internal infrastructure. 
  Irene is also involved in an advisory capacity with the Coworker Solidarity Fund, a US-based 501(c)(4). 
  **Should a governance decision involving these or any other financial ties arise, Irene will recuse themselves 
  from decision-making.** Additionally, while the following does not fall within the scope of any reasonable
  conflict of interest policy and is not within the scope of the recusal promise, 
  Irene chooses to affirm that they have many personal ties to trans, disabled and 
  neurodivergent tech workers, and are involved with providing and encouraging peer support to same. 
  Irene views the broader queer, disabled, and neurodivergent communities as the primary people to whom 
  they are responsible as an activist, regardless of whatever other affiliations they may have.

- **Jade** is currently not working on anything else relevant to Lix development. 
  She thus declares that she has **no conflicts of interest** regarding the governance of Lix. 

- **Kate Temkin** is the CEO and one-third owner of **Tactile Metrology LLC (TMLLC)**, a company that currently 
  sponsors Lix development. TMLLC declares that it has no financial stake in the future of Lix or Nix,
  no ties to the military-industrial-complex, and a strong commitment to avoiding such ties. TMLLC is
  owned by individuals, and not VC investors. **Should any decision arise in which TMLLC's interests are
  relevant, Kate will recuse herself from the relevant decision-making**.

- **Lily** is currently on leave, and will not participate in governance decisions until she returns.

- **Lunaphied** declare that they have **no conflicts of interest** regarding the governance of Lix.

- **pennae** declare that they have **no conflicts of interest** regarding the governance of Lix.

  financial interests arise, she will recuse herself from the relevant decision-making.**

- **Qyriad** is a one-third owner of **Tactile Metrology LLC (TMLLC)**, a company that currently 
  sponsors Lix development. TMLLC declares that it has no financial stake in the future of Lix or Nix,
  no ties to the military-industrial-complex, and a strong commitment to avoiding such ties. TMLLC is
  owned by individuals, and not VC investors. **Should any decision arise in which TMLLC's interests are 
  relevant,Qyriad will recuse herself from the relevant decision-making**.

- **raitobezarius** declares that he's self-employed in a cooperative, offers Nix-based consulting and training. 
  He has currently no stake in the cooperative, though this will change soon. He's also employed by INRIA until
  August 2024 on Rust formal verification matters. **Should a governance decision involving these or any other 
  financial ties arise, raitobezarius will recuse himself from decision-making.**
  Additionally, raitobezarius is co-president of DGNum (dgnum.eu), a French "loi 1901" nonprofit organization 
  aiming to promote the parisian Ecole Normale Superieure (45 rue d'Ulm, 75005 Paris) excellence on computer 
  science using heavily Nix/NixOS based technologies.

- **Rebecca Turner** works for [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), a financial
  services startup that [uses
