TODO List
==========

## Move to lix.systems Blockers

- Replace the "lix-managed systems" graphic with an image of our logo on a screen.
- Replace the placeholders for each of the three main page "why lix" points.
- Put this up on GH pages?

## Soft Release Blockers

- Remove the "pending pull request" from the install page, once that's merged.
- Figure out where "usability" should link to.
- Create a `/community-standards` page (jade is creating text)
- Create our contributor guide and squish it onto `/contributing` (raito is providing text).
- Replace the favicon with a flavicon (the lix logo).

## After Soft Release

### Misc

- Fix the way CSS makes the page look on narrower monitors
- Fix the CSS vertical alignment on webkit mobile
- Figure out where to link the "Docs" link to, and uncomment it.

### Content

- Screenshots (incl. maybe of Xil) showing ergonomics enhancements in the /about page.
- Create `/roadmap`.
- Create `/infrastructure`.
 
### Graphics
 
- Add nice images to the "/about" page.
- Replace the primary "hero" graphic with a Lix one.
- Monocolor the social media icons and then apply the color filter.
